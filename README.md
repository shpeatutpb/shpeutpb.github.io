## To do

## Steps to Edit

**1. Download Project**
* Click on **<>Code**
* Download ZIP
* Unzip the file

**2. Edit**
* Upload/open folder in **VSCode**
* Click on `events.html` and edit as needed
* Make sure _File > Auto Save_
* In `index.html`, you can click on _Run > Start Debugging_ to open `localhost` in browser and see changes
* Once complete, Copy/Paste edits to `events.html` file on Github
* AND **Commit changes...**. You can also **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.** for edits to be reviewed before being made public.

> ⚠️ **Note:** `index.html` is the file to the main page. Only edit if necessary

**3. Test**
* Make sure to check the [site](https://shpeutpb.github.io/) for updates
* Remember, it might take a few minutes for site to display changes
  
> ⚠️ **Note:** While there are certainly more efficient ways to edit projects on GitHub, given the constraints of time and knowledge, the above procedure will be followed.
